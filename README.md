# Data Structures repository

## Summary :
In the [InfoArena_Problems](https://github.com/MihaiB-dev/Data_Structures/tree/main/InfoArena_Problems) are a variety of solved exercices in which are used Data Structures such as : ***Hash, Heap, Stack, Deque and RMQ***. All of the problems passed the tests from the Infoarena site. 

Next there is [examene](https://github.com/MihaiB-dev/Data_Structures/tree/main/examene) that has a PDF with an exam, more to be added.

In the next part, there are 4 labs:   
1. [Lab3](https://github.com/MihaiB-dev/Data_Structures/tree/main/lab3) -> Create Linked Lists
2. [Lab4](https://github.com/MihaiB-dev/Data_Structures/tree/main/lab4) -> Create Heap
3. [Lab5](https://github.com/MihaiB-dev/Data_Structures/tree/main/lab5) -> Create Binary Search Tree
4. [Lab6](https://github.com/MihaiB-dev/Data_Structures/tree/main/lab6) -> Create Hash Direct addressing

[tema1](https://github.com/MihaiB-dev/Data_Structures/tree/main/tema1) consists of multiple sorted algorithms: ***Merge Sort, Shell Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort and Radix Sort***. They were all tested with 10^4 numbers till 10^8 in random format,reversed and sorted, 10 times each. More details there. Also there is a powerpoint with the final results in which all of the sorted algorithms are compared.

[tema2](https://github.com/MihaiB-dev/Data_Structures/tree/main/tema2) is a construction of the ***Red Black Tree***. The remove function is the only one under development. Future updates: create a visualization using gif.
