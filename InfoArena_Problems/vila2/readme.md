# Vila 2

***Link: https://www.infoarena.ro/problema/vila2***

Along the Autostrada Soarelui, beautiful villas were built , numbered in order with numbers from 1 to n . A solarium lives in each villa. The administration has come to the conclusion that Solarians get along better the closer their ages are, that's why it is interested in finding out the maximum age difference between any two neighbors.

### Requirement
Knowing the age of each solarian, find out the maximum age difference between two neighbors. By Solarian neighbors I mean two residents for whom the modulus of the difference between the numbers of their villas does not exceed the number k .

### Input data
On the first line of the vila2.in input file, the numbers n and k are written , separated by a single space. On the following lines , they are in whole numbers, representing, in order, the ages of the solarians.

### Output data
The first line of the vila2.out file will contain the maximum difference found.

### Restrictions
- 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000
- 1 ≤ k ≤ n/2
- A solarian lives at most 30,000 years
