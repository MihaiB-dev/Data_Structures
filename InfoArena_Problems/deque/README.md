Given a string A with N integers. For each subsequence of length K determine the minimum, and then calculate the sum of these minimums.

### Requirement
Display the requested amount.

### Input data
On the first line of the file deque.in are the numbers N and K with the meaning in the statement. On the next N lines there is an integer from the given string.

### Output data
In the output file deque.out there will be a single integer representing the requested amount.

### Restrictions and specifications
1 ≤ N ≤ 5 000 000
1 ≤ K ≤ N
The elements in the string will have values ​​between -10 000 000 and 10 000 000
For the result, it is recommended to use 64 - bit integer types
### Example
